                    My name is Lara Buiting, I am a 17-year-old software development student from the Netherlands.
                    When I am not working with code or busy programming, I like to make illustrations or play games
                    with my friends.
                    I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, and I am still eager to learn more.

                <h1 class="aboutTitles">How did I get interested in programming?</h1>
                <p>
                    When I was younger, I grew up with a dad who was already in the coding industry and a twin brother
                    who was interested in learning to code a bit and figuring out how the games we liked playing worked or
                    were made. So, we tried making our own games with Scratch which was not really code but a block-based visual
                    language. But it was sparking something in me, maybe I want to do something with this. So, when I had to choose
                    an extra subject in high school, I thought, “Well, I am interested in coding but do not know much about it maybe
                    this is my time to see if this is something for me”. That was the first time I got in contact with HTML and CSS.
                    I really liked it; I liked designing and making the blank page look cool with just my code.

        <!-- What am I doing currently and want to do in the future -->
        <div class="aboutMeContainerStart">
            <div class="section">
                <h1 class="aboutTitles">What am I doing now?</h1>
                <p>
                    When I got to my current school, I learned a lot of different things and am still learning, I learned to
                    make some simple 2D platformers, make better websites. But what I think is the coolest is learning and figuring
                    out how to solve problems. Even when they are harder, I really get joy out of struggling and then figuring something
                    out or making the inner workings of a game or app. So, for what kind of developer I would want to be I think I would
                    want to become a backend developer.
