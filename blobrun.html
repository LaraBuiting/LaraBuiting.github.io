                In my first year we had to do an ambition project. Since I did not know what I wanted to do I
                thought we had a little bit of coding with C# and making simple games. So, I decided I will make
                a 2D platformer game. That is how Blob run was born. I wanted to take inspiration from games like
                Mario, so I looked for free assets and started by making the map. After that I started coding the
                jumping, walking & the collisions.

                It is about a blob trying to find the end of his journey by getting over obstacles. I made everything
                myself except for the assets those were made by Kenney. Since before this game I only made a pong
                clone in class it was figuring things out. But with the help of some tutorials and my teacher I was
                able to figure most of it out.

                It was made in Unity because that was the program, we use in class most of the time,
                I also used the internet, and for the programming language I used I used C#. I also used
                the animator inside of Unity.
