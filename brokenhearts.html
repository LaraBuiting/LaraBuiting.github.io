                It is a simple game made with MonoGame just to learn and practice with it. You have boxes and when you click it an area will
                open and numbers will show up, these numbers indicate if there is a heart nearby. You must avoid the hearts which you could
                mark with an arrow. When you open a box which has a heart inside all the hearts will appear and it is game over.

                I wanted to practice coding with MonoGame because games like Stardew valley are made using it. So, when I had the chance to work
                with something else then Unity, I thought letâ€™s try MonoGame, I first started with a tutorial to figure out how it worked and
                after that I started making minesweeper.

                I learned a lot about how MonoGame worked. It was hard at first but once I tried a tutorial to explain how it was set up and
                worked it was really fun to figure out and use.

                I made the sprites for all the numbers, icons and boxes. So for the numbers I made 1 through 9, for the icons I made a heart,
                a broken heart and an arrow. You can mark a box with the arrow and if you click a heart you lose and they break.
                Down here you can see al the sprites I made and the 3 stages of the game which show you the main parts.
